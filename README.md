Examples of CMRX use

This repository contains simple examples of CMRX use. You can use them to understand how CMRX is being used in your project.

Each subdirectory contains one independent project that uses CMRX.

This repository submodules CMRX repository, so make sure to run:

~~~~~~~~~~~~
git submodule update --init --recursive
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initialize it. The `--recursive` switch is optional as it is only needed for CTest right now.
